## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Lemonade

* When was the company incorporated?

April 2015

* Who are the founders of the company?

Founders of Lemonade are Shai Wininger and Daniel Schreiber

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

	With the growing number of younger generations primarily purchasing insurance via online terminals, Lemonade was created in New York City with a “social-first” approach to insurance. Meaning that they innovated the way insurance can be purchased from a traditional broker to having individuals purchase insurance through their user interface.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

As of March 10, 2020; Lemonade has received $480 million in funding, $300 million of which came from Series D funding that led investor SoftBank provided in 2019. Funding was also received from Allianz, Sequoia and Aleph. (Forbes, 2020)

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

	The current problem that Lemonade is trying to solve within their insurance sector is that there is a lack of trust when it comes to purchasing insurance. Some individuals often do not like the insurance company no matter how much money these insurance companies have. Individuals believe that once a claim is submitted, they will not get reimbursed or paid once the claim is processed.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

	The intended customers at Lemonade are Gen Y and Z, those who are 18 to 25 years of age. 60% of health insurance purchased by this age demographic was purchased online as opposed to the seeing in-store brokers. (Productmint, 2020) However, as the world becomes more technologically driven, the customer demographic is slowly expanding to those in the Gen X demographic.

	At Lemonade when a person purchases an insurance policy in a matter of 90 seconds and have claims approved in as little as 3 second. (Stankiwicz Kevin, 2020) This allows individuals to gain the trust of the company as they are assured they will receive their monies respectively from their filed claims promptly.

	Lemonade is also established itself as a public benefit corporation using a flat-fee model that many tech companies adopt but is not of common practice within the insurance sector. Meaning that when Lemonade customers pay for insurance or claims, Lemonade will keep at portion, i.e. 25 cents per dollar, and use any remaining money that was unused from the claim or insurance purchase and use it to donate to charity on your behalf and of your choosing.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

	The domain Lemonade is in the financial industry is insurance.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

	Many insurance companies do not rely on organic and internal innovation. Many insurance companies have turned to innovative start ups who ally themselves with InsurTech. Stakeholders are aware that organic growth is not enough in a rapid changing industry and require these start ups to extrapolate as much savings and efficiency within current insurance industry models.

	AI has also played a major role in innovation within the insurance sector. AI based agents work along side human colleagues assist in customer service related inquires to help with the speed and accuracy of the service delivered. An example of this AMELIA developed by IP Soft, which is a next-generation digital insurance agent. (IPSoft, 2019)

	Over the years, customer needs, knowledge and expectations have continued to expand and continually change with present times. Constant change continues to overwhelm customers and often loyalty to insurance companies begin to deteriorate as we grow accustom to the notion of immediacy. It is important for companies to dive beyond their core product line and offer non life insurance products that add value to the core insurance products;(i.e. travel insurance, credit insurance, disaster insurance). (Deloitte, 2020)

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Other companies within this domain and are direct competitors of Lemonade are (Craft, 2020):
•	Slice Labs
•	Cover
•	Spixii
•	Cape Analytics

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

	Lemonade uses both AI and psychological studies of economic decision making to disrupt the insurance industry as they continue to offer individuals insurance while giving back unused funds to to not-for-profit charities within the community. With lack of transparency with insurance companies, Lemonade has made transparency and overcoming conflicts a pillar of interest for innovation. (Aziz Afdhel, 2020) With transparency a focus of interest Lemonade invented the Lemonade Giveback, where unused premiums are donated on the customers behalf to their charity of choosing. Using their business model to transform a necessary part of our everyday lives to do a social good as well.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Core metrics used within this domain to measure success is as follows:

1.	Traffic: Lemonade uses an app called Product Hunt and was the first insurance company to launch on this platform. Product Hunt allow users to find new products or services in which ever industry they search. Lemonade has found that the traffic generated from Product hut equates the amount of homeowners and renters in California and New York. (Wininger Shai, 2016)

2.	Conversion: Lemonade looked at their homepage performance to see if they can funnel more interactions from quote to payment. Improvement of the user interface by adding brand colours showed an increase of “click through rate” conversion from 14.8% to 30%. (Wininger Shai, 2016)

3.	Revenue: Lemonade uses number of policies sold as a metric to measure success. Revenue is used as a baseline to determine success.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

	Lemonade has reached $1 million ARR in the second quarter of 2017 and passed $10 million ARR 10 months later. (Schreiber Daniel, 2019) Proving to be one of the fastest growing tech company within 2.5 years. Although ARR is common measurement when measure growth, other indicators such as brand notoriety surpassed those who have been in the domain for many years. Lemonade surpassed All State and Liberty Insurance in brand Google searches in the US.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

	Lemonade’s focus is on homeowner, renters and pet insurance; all important insurance but not ones that currently stand out from other insurance companies. As stated, many individuals are more interest in purchasing insurance that work with their current premiums. For example, pet insurance often covers vet bills or prescription for the pet. However, Lemonade can offer a lost pet insurance where they can provide money to individual who may need material or further resources to try to locate their missing pet.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

	Offering the lost pet insurance would benefit the company because this is a unique insurance add on that insurance companies do not provide. Insurance companies do not provide insurance on lost pet as there could be potential fraud and security breaches. However, this would fit in line with their “Lemonade Giveback” initiative brand in helping pet owners find their pets; doing a social good while providing a service.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

	Having the pet chipped and it’s information saved to a database and providing the pet with a unique QR scan code can provide individuals who have found that pet the ability to scan and notifying the insurance company or the direct owner that the pet has been found.
